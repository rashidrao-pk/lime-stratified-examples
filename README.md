This Repositry contains codes to Produce Results for our publication <b>'Using stratified sampling to improve LIME Image explanations'</b> published in <b>[AAAI-2024](https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/)</b> by Modifying <b>[Lime-Image](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime)</b> and introducing a novel sampling stragtegy into LIME-Image. The Effect of introducing this sampling stratgey is presented in `Results` Section and can be validated by running codes in next few sections.

### Paper contribution 
In this paper we:
- investigate the distribution of the dependent variable in
the sampled synthetic neighborhood of LIME Image,
identifying in the undersampling a cause that results in
inadequate explanations;
- delve into the causes of the synthetic neighborhood inad-
equacy, recognizing a link with the Shapley theory;
- reformulate the synthetic neighborhood generation using
an unbiased stratified sampling strategy;
- provide empirical proofs of the advantage of using strat-
ified sampling for LIME Image on a popular dataset.

- Python
- Tensorflow
- Option: NVIDIA GPU + CUDA

Install all the required libraries by running following line:

```
git clone https://github.com/rashidrao-pk/lime-stratified-examples/
cd /lime-stratified-examples
git clone https://github.com/rashidrao-pk/lime_stratified
pip install -r requirements.txt 

```

### Structure of the artifact

This artifact is structured as follows:

- the [`data/`](https://github.com/rashidrao-pk/lime-stratified-examples/tree/main/data) folder contains a subset of the [ImageNet Object Localization Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/imagenet-object-localization-challenge/data) (the first 150 images) used to generate the plots and benchmarks of the paper;

- the [`lime_stratified/`](https://github.com/rashidrao-pk/lime_stratified) that contains a modified version of <b>[LIME](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime)</b> with the proposed stratified sampling approach.

- the [`results/`](https://github.com/rashidrao-pk/lime-stratified-examples/tree/main/result) folder, which contains the results after running the artifact.

- two notebooks:

  * [`Run_Benchmark.ipynb`](https://github.com/rashidrao-pk/lime-stratified-examples/blob/main/Run_Benchmark.ipynb) runs the (long) benchmark on a subset of the <b>ImageNet Object Localization Challenge</b>, generating the CSV file in the [`results/`](https://github.com/rashidrao-pk/lime-stratified-examples/tree/main/result)  folder. 
  Inside the file there is an option to also run a "simplified" version of the benchmark (just one image) instead of the "full" version. The simplified version will run all the steps, but on a single image.

  * [`Paper_Figures.ipynb`](https://github.com/rashidrao-pk/lime-stratified-examples/blob/main/Paper_Figures.ipynb) which reads the CSV file and generates the plots included in the paper.

The [precomputed CSV](https://github.com/rashidrao-pk/lime-stratified-examples/blob/main/result/precomputed_results_1000_1_150_%5B50%2C%20100%2C%20150%2C%20200%5D.csv) file is already included in the `results/` folder.


---
### How to run the artifact

The `Run_Benchmark.ipynb` will take a long tame (more than 1 day) to run all the experiments and generate the CSV file. All explanations are computed 10 times and then averaged, to better stabilize the results and reduce randomization.

The `Paper_Figures.ipynb` has several targets: for the single explanations, it will take a few minutes. For the plots generated starting from the CSV file, in will take a few seconds.

---
### Run Examples

You can run `Run_Benchmark.ipynb` to regenerate all the results. Alternatively, the precomputed CSV file used for the paper is included.

Then run  `Paper_Figures.ipynb` to generate the plots.
### Screenshots
### Performance Measures to Evaluate Explanations:
<b>How can we evaluate an XAI method for images? to decide the quality of an explanation</b><br>
we have utilised few evaluation metrices to quantify the base Lime-Image approach and lime_stratified approach including.
1. Visual Evaluation
    - Heatmaps for explanation
2. Statistical Evaluation
    - Coeffecient of Variation $(CV(\beta))$
    - Inter-Quantile Range Coverage $(RC\_Y)$
